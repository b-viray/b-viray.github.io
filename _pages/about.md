I am a Craig McKibben and Sarah Merner Professor at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.uw.edu/) located in Seattle, Washington. I am an arithmetic geometer broadly interested in rational and algebraic points on varieties. Overviews of different aspects of my research program and links to talks can be found on my [Research] page. Complete lists of my preprints and publications can be found on my [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/viray_b_1.html) page and on my [MathSciNet author page](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/890397) (subscription required). 

At the University of Washington, I organize the [Number Theory Seminar](https://math.washington.edu/events/series/number-theory-seminar). I am a member of the [Women in Numbers](https://womeninnumbertheory.org/) steering committee and a co-organizer and co-founder of the Roots of Unity workshop series. 

I firmly believe that a collaborative and supportive research environment stimulates excellent research. To prove radically new theorems, you have to deeply and strongly believe in your own ideas, and that is easiest when one is surrounded by a supportive community. Conversely, biased expectations and harassment stifle and suffocate one's creativity and ability to think (not to mention being downright distressing). In my roles as organizer, advisor, and mentor, I strive to create these collaborative and supportive spaces, and am receptive to feedback on ways to improve. Additionally, if someone has or is experiencing harassment, and would like to talk, please reach out to me. (At the University of Washington, I am a mandatory reporter, which means I must report any possible discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct involving a UW student, but I do not have to report the student's name.
