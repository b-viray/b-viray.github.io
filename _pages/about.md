I currently hold the Craig McKiiben and Sarah Merner Professorship at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.uw.edu/) located in Seattle, Washington. I work in number theory and arithmetic geometry. Complete lists of my preprints and publications can be found on my [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/viray_b_1.html) page and on my [MathSciNet author page](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/890397). Overviews of my research areas and links to talks can be found on my [Research] page
