I am an arithmetic geometer and the Craig McKibben and Sarah Merner Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washginton](http://uw.edu). Much of my work focuses on how the geometry of varieties influences the existence and distribution of rational and algebraic points.
