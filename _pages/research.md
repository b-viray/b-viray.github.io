##Arithmetic geometry##

My research lies in arithmetic geometry.  As the name suggests, this research area sits at the interface of two fields: *arithmetic* (the study of integers and rational numbers, which is heavily influenced by the prime numbers); and *geometry* (the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional shapes).  These distinct areas are brought together through the study of solutions to polynomial equations, i.e., the study of varieties.

    A guiding philosophy of this area is **Geometry controls arithmetic**
    For example, since the geometry of the above variety on the right is more complicated than the one on the left (the one on the right has larger genus, which is seen by the increased `curviness' of the graph), the arithmetic properties of the variety on the right *should* also be more complicated.  This turns out to be true in two senses: the rational points (i.e., the solutions with all coordinates in $\mathbb{Q}$) on the variety on the right are sparser than those on the left, and it is harder to characterize all the rational points on the variety on the right.

    This philosophy provides a powerful perspective, but many mathematical questions need to be answered to make it precise.  Which aspects of the geometry are important for a given arithmetic property? When we try to understand finer arithmetic properties, do we need to delve deeper into the geometry? What are the limitations of this philosophy?
