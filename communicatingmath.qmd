### Communicating mathematics effectively ###

Communicating mathematics is an important part of one's job as a mathematician. When I started my mathematical career, I needed to devote a substantial amount of time and effort to improve at this skill, and this improvement was greatly facilitated by feedback from my peers and mentors.

I am continually trying to improve, so if you have any [feedback](https://forms.gle/S2F2vmyYZTiat5757) for me about parts of my papers or talks you did not understand as well as you would have liked, I would love to hear it!

In addition to continually trying to improve my own exposition, I have also developed a number of resources on how to give effective math talks.
