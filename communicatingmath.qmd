title: "Math talks"

Communicating mathematics is an important part of one's job as a mathematician. When I started my mathematical career, I needed to devote a substantial amount of time and effort to improve at this skill, and this improvement was greatly facilitated by feedback from my peers and mentors.

I am continually trying to improve, so if you have any [feedback](https://forms.gle/S2F2vmyYZTiat5757) for me about parts of my papers or talks you did not understand as well as you would have liked, I would love to hear it!

### Communicating mathematics effectively ###

In 2018, I co-organized (with John Voight) a week-long workshop titled *Communicating mathematics effectively*, for late-stage graduate students and early-stage postdocs in number theory to learn and develop strategies for giving clear, motivated, and informative talks; this workshop was funded by my CAREER grant.

In the years since, I have refined many of the workshop materials to work as stand-alone modules, which I have incorporated into graduate topics courses (one co-taught with Chris Hoffman).

* [The Value of Mathematical Storytelling](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202306/noti2714/noti2714.html) (joint with John Voight) 

    A Notices article laying out the philosophy of mathematical storytelling and how to carry it out in practice.
* [Worksheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMBzJgaEU3VGwa9dRO0Xu0V8WmSGWmunTmpyqz_43Kg/edit?usp=sharing) for gaining practice using mathematical storytelling:
    + ***7 elements of storytelling*** A worksheet working through translating the elements of storytelling to a mathematical perspective.
    + ***Storyboarding*** A worksheet with a step-by-step method to develop a storyboard. (See also [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UZlifnolhbSZ3kqXmEn_VsPCh4LjvXuf/view?usp=sharing) with some examples)
    + ***Talk plan self-assessment*** A checklist self-assessment to see if your talk is hitting the key narrative elements. 
    + ***Peer feedback form*** A worksheet giving structure for feedback from a practice talk.
* [Practical tips for giving and preparing a talk](resources/talktips.qmd) (This should be looked at *after* you have developed a compelling storyboard.)
