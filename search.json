    "text": "Communicating mathematics effectively\nCommunicating mathematics is an important part of one’s job as a mathematician. When I started my mathematical career, I needed to devote a substantial amount of time and effort to improve at this skill, and this improvement was greatly facilitated by feedback from my peers and mentors.\nI am continually trying to improve, so if you have any feedback for me about parts of my papers or talks you did not understand as well as you would have liked, I would love to hear it!\nIn addition to continually trying to improve my own exposition, I have also developed a number of resources on how to give effective math talks."

    "text": "I am an arithmetic geometer broadly interested in rational and algebraic points on varieties. Overviews of different aspects of my research program and links to talks can be found on my Research page. Complete lists of my preprints and publications can be found on my arXiv page and on my MathSciNet author page (subscription required).\nI firmly believe that a collaborative and supportive research environment stimulates excellent research. To prove radically new theorems, one has to deeply and strongly believe in one’s own ideas, and that is easiest when one is surrounded by a supportive community. Conversely, biased expectations and harassment stifle and suffocate one’s creativity and ability to think (not to mention being downright distressing). In my roles as organizer, advisor, mentor, teacher, and collaborator, I strive to create collaborative and supportive spaces, and am receptive to feedback on ways to improve. Additionally, if someone has or is experiencing harassment, and would like to talk, please reach out to me. (Note: at the University of Washington, I am a mandatory reporter, which means I must report any possible discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct involving a UW student, but I do not have to report the student’s name. See here for more details.)\n\nI have been a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington since 2014. I currently hold the Craig McKibben and Sarah Merner Professorship in the department. At the University of Washington, I teach a range of classes at all levels, and I organize the Number Theory Seminar.\n\nIt is my responsibility and privilege to be able to contribute to the mathematical community more broadly than through research alone. From 2020 to 2026, I served on the Council of the American Mathematical Society, first as a member at large, and then as Vice President, and from 2022-26 on the Executive Committee of Council. I I am a member of the Women in Numbers steering committee and a co-organizer and co-founder of the Roots of Unity workshop series."

    "text": "Let C be an algebraic curve over Q, in other words, a complex Riemann surface that is described by a system of polynomial equations of rational coefficients.\nof genus at least 2, i.e., a 1-dimensional negatively curved complex manifold defined by polynomial equations with rational coefficients.\nA celebrated result of Faltings implies that, despite the hyperbolicity of C, all algebraic points on C are organized into families of nonnegative curvature. We explore how these families provide structure to access the arithmetic of C and give some applications to the study of elliptic curves. This talk is based in part on joint work with A. Bourdon, Ö. Ejder, Y. Liu, and F. Odumodu, with I. Vogt, and with I. Balçik, S. Chan, and Y. Liu.",
